Prior to this lecture, you should have read chapters 2 and 3 of
[Regression and Other Stories](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/ROS.pdf){target="_blank"}.

## Always plot your data!

All of these data sets have the same average and standard deviation for their
x and y variables, and the same correlation between x and y.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(cowplot)

crashes <- here("Examples",
                "crashes.csv") %>%
  read_csv()

commuting <- here("Examples",
                "commuting.csv") %>%
  read_csv() 

play_data_extra <- tibble(A = rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 3), 
                          B = rnorm(100, mean = 30, sd = 12),
                          C = rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 3),
                          D = rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 3))

play_data <- tibble(A = rnorm(1000, mean = 30, sd = 3),
                    B = rnorm(1000, mean = 30, sd = 12),
                    C = rnorm(1000, mean = 30, sd = 3),
                    D = rnorm(1000, mean = 30, sd = 3)) %>%
  rbind(play_data_extra) %>%
  mutate(E = rnorm(1100, mean = (min(D) + max(D) / 2), 
                   sd = ((max(D) - min(D)) / 5))) %>%
  mutate(E = case_when(E > max(D) ~ mean(D),
                       E < min(D) ~ mean(D),
                       TRUE ~ E))

## Visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable

A **histogram** is a common and useful way to visualize the distribution of a continuous
variable. A histogram is a special bar chart where the categories along the x-axis
are bins (i.e. ranges) of values for a variable, and the heigth of the bars indicates
the number of observations within each bin.

If you have a data set loaded into R as a data frame, you can quickly create a 
histogram using the `geom_histogram()` function within `ggplot()`. In this example, 
I have a data frame called `crashes` and one of the variables in that data frame is 
called `crashes_per_km2`. The `bins` argument indicates the number of bins I want 
in my histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(crashes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = crashes_per_km2),
                 color = "black",
                 fill = "pink",
                 bins = 30) +
  theme_minimal()
```

You can also create a histogram in Excel. You need to define a set of threshold
values for your bins, then use the "Histogram" tool in the "Data Analysis"
toolpack, which you'll find on the "Data" ribbon if you've enabled it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-hist.gif"))
```

A jittered (or one-dimensional) scatter plot can be another good way to visualize 
the distribution of a variable. Making your points very small (`size = 0.5`) and
transparent (`alpha = 0.5`) can be helpful if you have a lot of points plotted
on top of one another (a problem called overplotting).

```{r}
ggplot(crashes) +
  geom_point(aes(x = crashes_per_km2, y = 0),
             position = "jitter",
             size = 0.5,
             alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "",
                     breaks = c()) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

## Visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables

A more typical use of a scatter plot is to visualize the relationship between two 
continuous variables. In this example, I want to see the relationship between
population density (people per square kilometer) and crash density (crashes
per square kilometer). It is standard to have your outcome variable on the 
y-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(crashes) +
  geom_point(aes(x = ppl_per_km2, 
                 y = crashes_per_km2),
             size = 0.5,
             alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() 
```


It's straightforward to create a plot like this in Excel as well.

By default, Excel will guess what values you want on your x and y axes, and 
it sometimes guesses wrong. I recommend clearing out all the data series and
adding in the one you want manually to be sure that you're plotting what you 
think you're plotting.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-scatter.gif"))
```

The scatterplot above is for a dataset with 187 observations. Here is a scatterplot 
for a dataset with over 800,000 observations.
 
```{r}
ggplot(commuting) +
  geom_point(aes(x = INCTOT, 
                 y = TRANTIME),
             size = 0.5,
             alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

Overplotting is more of a problem in this case, and a heat map might be more legible.
This divides the plot area into a grid, with variation in color representing the number
of points within each grid cell.

```{r}
ggplot(commuting) +
  geom_bin_2d(aes(x = INCTOT, 
                 y = TRANTIME)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() 
```

You can also create a heat map from a hexagonal grid, which can sometimes 
make patterns a little more legible.

```{r}
ggplot(commuting) +
  geom_hex(aes(x = INCTOT, 
                 y = TRANTIME)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() 
```

There isn't a simple way to produce this type of heat map in Excel, although 
you could make something that looks a rectangular gridded heat map by using 
through a combination of manually defined bins, a pivot table, and conditional 
cell formatting.

## Decribing continuous variables

You can describe a continuous variable in terms of its **central tendency** and
its **spread**.

### Central tendency

The most common measure of central tendency is an **average**, which is also called a **mean**.

If you have a data set loaded into R as a data frame, you can calculate the average of
one of the variables using the `mean()` function. In this example, I have a data frame
called `crashes` and one of the variables in that data frame is called `crashes_per_km2`.

```{r}
mean(crashes$crashes_per_km2)
```

In Excel, you can use the AVERAGE() function.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-average.png"))
```

One problem with using an average value to describe your data is that a single observation
can have a big influence on the average if it has very high or very low values (we would
describe this as an **outlier**). A **median** is an alternative measure of central 
tendency. Half of the observations in your dataset have values below the median, and half 
the values in your dataset have values above the median.

You can calculate a median with the `median()` function in R or the MEDIAN() function in 
Excel.

Here are are histograms for two different variables with the same average and very
different medians.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist_no_out <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = A), bins = 20, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     breaks = c(10, 20, 30, 40)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 159, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

hist_out <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = C), bins = 100, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     breaks = seq(10, 110, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 159, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$C), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$C), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

plot_grid(hist_no_out, hist_out, nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(1, 3.5))
```

### Spread

A common measure of spread for a continuous variable is its **standard deviation**.

You can calculate a standard deviation using the `sd()` function in R, or the 
STDEV.S() function in Excel.

A smaller standard deviation means the values are less spread out. Here are 
histograms for two variables that have the same mean, but different standard
deviations.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist_skinny <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = A), bins = 40, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     limits = c(-10, 80),
                     breaks = seq(-10, 80, by=10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count", 
                     limits = c(0, 340),
                     breaks = seq(0, 340, by = 20)) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -5, y = 320, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nStandard deviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

hist_fat <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = B), bins = 40, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     limits = c(-10, 80),
                     breaks = seq(-10, 80, by=10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count", 
                     limits = c(0, 340),
                     breaks = seq(0, 340, by = 20)) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -5, y = 320, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$B), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$B), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nStandard deviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$B), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

plot_grid(hist_skinny, hist_fat, nrow = 1)
```

A standard deviation is related to the average difference between the value for an individual
observation and the average value, and it is sensitive to outliers. A measure of spread that
is less sensitive to outliers is the **interquartile range**, or the range of values between
the 25th percentile (i.e. the value that 25 percent of your observations will be below) and the
75th percentile (i.e the value that 75 percent of your observations will be above).

In R, you can calculate percentile values using the `quantile()`. Here's how you
would calculate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles (the 50th percentile is the 
median).

```{r}
quantile(crashes$crashes_per_km2, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
```


In Excel, you can calculate percentile values using PERCENTILE.INC().

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-pctile.png"))
```

Here are two distributions that are very different in terms of mean and standard deviation, 
but similar in terms of median and interquartile range.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist_no_out <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = A), bins = 20, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     breaks = c(10, 20, 30, 40)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 159, hjust = 0, vjust = 1,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nStandard\ndeviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$A), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nInterquartile\nrange:\n",
                          formatC(quantile(play_data$A, probs = c(0.25)), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          " to ",
                          formatC(quantile(play_data$A, probs = c(0.75)), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

hist_out <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = C), bins = 100, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable",
                     breaks = seq(10, 110, by = 10)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 159, hjust = 0, vjust = 1,
           label = paste0("Mean: ", 
                          formatC(mean(play_data$C), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nMedian: ",
                          formatC(median(play_data$C), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nStandard deviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$C), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          "\nInterquartile range: ",
                          formatC(quantile(play_data$C, probs = c(0.25)), format = "f", digits = 0),
                          " to ",
                          formatC(quantile(play_data$C, probs = c(0.75)), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

plot_grid(hist_no_out, hist_out, nrow = 1, rel_widths = c(1, 3.5))
```

One more measure of the spread of a variable that is very sensitive to outliers
is the **range** of the data: the difference between the minumum and maximum
values.

You can calculate the minumum value of a variable using the `min()` function in 
R or the MIN() function in Excel.

You can also quickly get a summary of a variable's range, interquartile range,
mean, and median using the `summary()` function in R.

```{r}
summary(crashes$crashes_per_km2)
```

Both standard deviation and range are sensitive to outliers and extreme
values, but they don't measure the same property. Here are two distributions
that have the same range, but different standard deviations.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist_2_mode <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = D), bins = 40, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 350, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Standard deviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$D), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

hist_normal_comp <- ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = E), bins = 40, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 65, hjust = 0,
           label = paste0("Standard deviation: ",
                          formatC(sd(play_data$E), format = "f", digits = 0))) +
  theme_minimal()

plot_grid(hist_2_mode, hist_normal_comp, nrow = 1)
```

## Describing the distribution of a continuous variable

In real life, it's common for variables to fall into histograms that are shaped
kind of like a bell (a bell curve). This is so common, that we call it 
a **normal distribution**. It looks something like this, with more values closer
the the average value, and fewer values farther from the average. It's symmetrical in 
the sense that values are as likely to be below average as above average (so the 
median will be almost the same as the mean).

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = B), bins = 30, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The methods we discuss in this class are based on an assumption that your continuous variables 
have an approximately normal distribution. Sometimes they don't. This one doesn't. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(crashes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = crashes_per_km2),
                 color = "gray",
                 fill = "pink",
                 bins = 20) +
  theme_minimal()
```

When you have a lot of lower values and fewer higher values like this, you can call this 
a left-skewed distribution (because there are more values on the left side of the 
histogram than on the right). A left-skewed distribution might indicate a **log-normal** 
distribution, where the logarithms of the values approximate a normal distribution better
than the values themselves do.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(crashes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = log(crashes_per_km2)),
                 color = "gray",
                 fill = "pink",
                 bins = 20) +
  theme_minimal()
```

You might also have a **bi-modal** distribution like the one below. Where the
histogram shows two distinct humps. This *might* suggest you have two different 
populations (or categories) in your data, and you might need to account for that
in your analysis somehow.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(play_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = C), bins = 100, fill = "pink", color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Value of a variable") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Count") +

  theme_minimal()
```


## Summarizing a categorical variable

Variation in a categorical variable is somewhat simpler. You've more or less
described it fully when you've reported the proportion of your sample in 
each category.

If I have a data frame in R called `commuting`, with a variable called `mode` to indicate
the typical mode of transportation to work, I can get the number of people
who report using each mode like this:

```{r}
commuting %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarise(number = n())
```

And I can show that as the proportions by dividing by the total sample size (which
would be the length of any of the data frame's columns).

```{r}
commuting %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarise(number = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = number / length(commuting$mode)) 
```

I can do something similar in Excel using a pivot table:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-pivot.gif"))
```

## Visualizing proportions

### Bar charts

A bar chart is a reasonable way to visualize proportions. You can create one
in R using `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
commuting %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarise(number = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = number / length(commuting$mode)) %>%
  
  ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = mode, y = proportion),
             stat = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = breaks <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),
                       labels = paste0(breaks * 100, "%")) +
    theme_minimal()  
```

And you can do something similar in Excel.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-bars.gif"))
```

When you have some very small categories, a tree map can be more legible than a 
bar chart.

```{r}
library(treemapify)

commuting %>%
  group_by(mode) %>%
  summarise(number = n()) %>%
  mutate(proportion = number / length(commuting$mode)) %>%
  
  ggplot() +
    geom_treemap(aes(area = proportion, fill = mode)) +
    geom_treemap_text(aes(area = proportion, label = mode),
                      color = "white") +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", 
                      guide = "none") # leave off the legend
  
```

And you can do something similar in Excel.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("unit-2",
                             "excel-tree-map.gif"))
```
